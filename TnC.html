      <h1>Please read the following terms and conditions carefully</h1>
      <h3>RACS is not the Department of Immigration but rather a Community Legal Centre</h3>
      <h3>The extent of RACS's involvement is, where the client's financial situation warrants it, to try to connect the client with external barristers and lawyers who can provide assistance on a pro-bono basis on an application for judicial review in the courts. RACS cannot assist everyone, or guarantee it can make a referral for the client.</h3>
      <h3>Referral for representation is a two step process: 1. Referral to a barrister to provid advice on whether the client would be likely to succeed on judicial review. 2 If the advice is that there is a good chance of success then RACS will try to organise representation for the client to run the matter in court and the client will communicate directly with the barrister/solicitor from then on. If the advice is that there is little or no chance of success, RACS cannot assist further.</h3>
      <h3>Racs is obliged to keep client information confidential. By agreeing to this referral, the client agrees to:
        <ul>
        <li>RACS sharing this information and any documents the client provides with RACS's network of barristers and lawyers who RACS may approach to assist.</li>
          <li>RACS sharing the client's information and any opinion obtained on the merits of the case with the case worker we received the referral from, RACS's network of barristers and lawyers, and if necessart, with all state Legal Aid offices, state law Society pro bono schemes, Justice Connect, PILCH, Refugee Legal (RILC), the Humanitarian Group, RAILS, ASRC and other not-for-profit groups that are working with the goal of ensuring access to justice for the fast track client group.</li>
