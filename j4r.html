  <body>
    <p> J4R@RACS aims to provide assistance to fast track applicants in New South Wales who have received a negative decision in the Immigration Assessment Authority (IAA) or have been excluded from review in the IAA by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection at the time it refuses applications for a protection visas. If capacity allows, we may extend the service to those in certain Immigration Detention Centres in limited circumstances.</p>
